# Speech Recognition with CNN
  recognise speach commands with a CNN

### Reference:
  - [Speech Recognition with Neural Networks](http://dkopczyk.quantee.co.uk/speech-nn/)
  
### Topics:
  1. Preprocessing audio files, and feature extraction (spectogram).
  2. Maintaing the same data distribution in the test/valid set, by separating subjects/users in a training and test/valid set.
  3. Training using Keras' fit_generator().
  4. Model visualisation, manually(?) and using TensorBoard.
