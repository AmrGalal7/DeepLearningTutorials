### Topics:
            1. Convolutional Denoising AutoEncoders (DAEs) for feature extraction.
            2. Content-based image retrieval based on features extracted from a DAE.
            3. Classificaiton using a CNN with features extracted from a DAE being the input to the classifier.
            4. Ranking-based average precision.
